##	Description

Work on this project was implemented at the request of the client, whose user story stated the following: “As a marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.” In response to this request, the webpage and its coding were studied and several issues were uncovered. The next step in the process was to come up with means to remedy the concerns of the client and deploy an more functional webpage.

The specific topic for this webpage was chosen by the client in relation to an identified issues that needed to be resolved.

The project solves the problem of a broken header link, coding that was unorganized and difficult to read – and so semantic elements were added to the HTML aspect of the code. By using these techniques the webpage has been optimized for search engine visibility.  

A great deal of knowledge was obtained through the design and completion of this project, from fortifying knowledge of HTML and CSS, research of questions using the internet, the process of using Git and Github, and learning how to debug broken code.

The steps required to start the development environment running include: opening VS Code, Github, Git (and Terminal). Once the project was created on my local repo then it was linked to Github, to save changes as updates are made. In Github, a remote repo is created and linked via Git. Once this link was made using several Git terminal commands, the project was “off and running.” The project was created using VS Code. It is here that the bulk of time spent designing was spent. Following these steps, the project and changes were uploaded to Github. The final project was then deployed to the web.
